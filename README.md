#Overview
This program can be used to predict the IC50 of a molecule for "a precise pretein". This program is based on using different machine learning models such as ... . To predict the pIC50 of a particular molecule, the program uses the respective SMILES of the molecule of interest. In this repository the user will find the jupyter notebook used to developp the different models and also to get the final pIC50 result.

#Project Structre
